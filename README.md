Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  This app was created to record weight and meet weight goals. This app is used as a easy way to keep track of your weight loss or gain journey.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  This app includes a registration screen, login screen and a screen to add date and weght. With these screens a user can create an account, log nto thier account and access thier weights. The user can also add, update, and delete thier weights.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  I started off the with layout, once the layout was completed. I worked on the actions and intents. When learning something new I tend to focus on the resoueces provided as well as using stackflow and videos. For me research is key. I also like to seek help from those who have more experience then me. This can be helpful because they know what has not been succesful. They also can give you insight to avoid mastakes that someone new will make.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  I tested the app by downloading the app to my device and using it like I would any other app. Testing is important because you do not want to release something that is not fully functional.
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  I would say for me the making sure functionality is sound is challenging. Going through your code making sure it is sound and have annotations is something that takes time. Sometimes if a problem is present you may have to go through every line to make sure nothing was missed.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The part that was succesful was creating the database to store and view information. This was my first go at making an app so I was excited to see how apps work. The login and storing passwords is something thatI wondered how it works. Creating the app and learning the inner workings was very exciting to me.
